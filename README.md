# Dual-Path Convolutional Image-Text Embedding

This repository contains the code for our paper [Dual-Path Convolutional Image-Text Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05535). Thank you for your kindly attention. 

**The compelete code will be uploaded in two weeks. I am adding illustrations and comments to the code for using. You can check my progress as follows.**

### CheckList
- [x] Get word2vec weight

- [x] Data Preparation (Flickr30k)
- [ ] Train on Flickr30k
- [ ] Test on Flickr30k

- [ ] Data Preparation (MSCOCO)
- [ ] Train on MSCOCO
- [ ] Test on MSCOCO

- [ ] Data Preparation (CUHK-PEDES)
- [ ] Train on CUHK-PEDES
- [ ] Test on CUHK-PEDES



# Prepare Data
1. Extract wrod2vec weights. Follow the instruction in `./word2vector_matlab`;

2. Prepare the dataset. Follow the instruction in `./data`. You can choose one dataset to run.
Three datasets need different prepocessing. I write the instruction for [Flickr30k](https://github.com/layumi/Image-Text-Embedding/tree/master/data/Flickr30k), MSCOCO and CUHKPEDES.

3. Prepocessing may make you lose your patience. But let's just start trainning!!
