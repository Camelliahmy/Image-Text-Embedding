# Dual-Path Convolutional Image-Text Embedding

Thank you for your kindly attention. 

I am preparing the supplementary document. **The code will be uploaded in one month.**

Dual-Path Convolutional Image-Text Embedding    https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05535

# Prepare Data
1. Extract wrod2vec weights. Follow the instruction in `./word2vector_matlab`;

2. Prepare the dataset. Follow the instruction in `./data`. You can choose one dataset to run.
Three datasets need different prepocessing. I write the instruction for [Flickr30k](), MSCOCO and CUHKPEDES.

3. Prepocessing may make you lose your patience. But let's just start training!!


### CheckList
- [x] Get word2vec weight

- [x] Data Preparation (Flickr30k)
- [ ] Train on Flickr30k
- [ ] Test on Flickr30k

- [ ] Data Preparation (MSCOCO)
- [ ] Train on MSCOCO
- [ ] Test on MSCOCO

- [ ] Data Preparation (CUHK-PEDES)
- [ ] Train on CUHK-PEDES
- [ ] Test on CUHK-PEDES
